            <h2>Bookings made easy</h2>
            <p>To make a reservation, please visit our website's 'book a table' area.
                This will display all available dates and allow you to book directly.
                Alternatively, you can utilize the 'contact section' contact box, being
                sure to include both your email address and phone number.
            </p>
            <h3>Cancellation fees and Deposits</h3>
            <p>We kindly request a card authentication of £10 per person as a reservation
                deposit. This involves securely entering your card details through a provided
                link to confirm your booking. Rest assured, no funds will be deducted at this stage.
                However, in the event of cancellation without 24 hours' notice or a no-show on the
                reserved day, a charge will be applied.</p>
            <h3>Seating Arrangements</h3>
            <p>Only the times specified are covered by table reservations. If at all possible, we'll give
                you more time at your table to eat and let you stay over the scheduled hour. The staff may
                kindly ask you to move into the bar to continue your evening if this is not possible during
                busy times, so please be aware that this is not guaranteed.</p>
            <h3>Arrival Time</h3>
            <p>As opposed to when you arrive, your booking period begins when your reservation is confirmed
                for that time. The amount of food you can order will be limited if you arrive more than 15 minutes
                after your reservation time during peak times due to the strong demand. We advise you to plan
                your travel in advance and arrive as soon as you can. Guests who arrive too late for the kitchen to make
                food during your time slot will forfeit the reservation entirely. In order to prevent any disappointment,
                we typically encourage everyone to arrive early than your scheduled time to grab a drink at the bar.</p>
            <h3>Unique Considerations</h3>
            <p>If you are celebrating, be sure to let us know! To make it more personal, you are allowed to provide table
                balloons and a cake if you want to make the most of your time with us and make it extra special. If you
                would like us to prepare celebration plates for you, please let us know in the 'special requests' box when
                making your reservation or when you arrive.</p>
            <h3>Hypersensitivities</h3>
            <p>In order to take into account diners with allergies and sensitivities,
                Yours takes allergens very seriously. While every precaution is taken to avoid cross-contamination, we cannot guarantee that our meals are completely
                free of residues. We suggest that you let us know about any visitors who have special dietary needs or allergies
                when they arrive.</p>
            <h3>Large party Reservation and Fixed Menus</h3>
            <p>Our tables can accommodate no more than 6 people. Bookings for larger groups are possible, but they must be requested
                and are dependent on availability. We are unable to ensure particular table requests due to the design of our restaurant.
                You must select from a set menu for any gathering larger than 8 people. Requests for the set menus to be sent via email should
                be made through the contact box. </p>
            <h3>Unlimited brunch</h3>
            <p>Two limitless drink options are available to go with our delectable brunch offerings. Simply navigate to the website
                to schedule your reservation using the "brunch" option. When you arrive, let the attendants know that you'd like
                'bottomless beverages', and we'll start the 90-minute countdown for you.
                Bottomless Bloody Marys or Mimosas plus one brunch item = £32 per person
                Prosecco Bottomless with one brunch item = £32 per person.</p>
            <h3>kids and Teenagers</h3>
            <p>Do not hesitate to make a reservation for your family as we happily welcome kids and young adults in our restaurant.
                However, after 9 p.m., we are unwilling to admit anyone beneath the age limit of 18 due to licensing restrictions.
                Consequently, the final dinner reservation would be from 19:00 to 21:00. We also have a "ask 25" policy, so if you
                happen to look younger than that, don't be insulted if we ask for proof of your age.</p>
            <h3>Attire Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Our dress code is strictly smart casual, despite the fact that we like seeing how creative our guests can be with
                their wardrobe selections. If you arrive too casually, you might not be let in, so dress to impress. Avoid wearing
                hoodies, sportswear, athletic shoes, or clothing with prominent logos. Sunglasses, large chains, and hats must all
                be taken off before entering. We'll take into account intelligent trainers.</p>
            <h3>Occasions</h3>
            <p>Planning to arrange a gathering or event? Search no further. Our team will contact you after we have all the information
                about your event request at reservations@Paterroskitchen.co.uk. We'll do our best to satisfy every demand, whether it's
                for a sizable corporate party, an official dinner, or just an informal get-together with friends.</p>
            <h3>Beverage Stations</h3>
            <p>Sadly, we seldom make reservations for drinking tables in advance. There are two alternatives available if you merely want
                to join us for drinks. You can come in and join us at the bar at any time, provided the space is not already filled when
                you arrive. You are welcome to use any available bar tables for complimentary seating. Booth tables can also be requested
                (although not guaranteed) upon arrival or after 11 p.m., when dinner is over. On a first come, first served basis, these,
                however, have a minimum expenditure requirement. </p>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Every Thursday through Sunday, feel the rhythm of Paterros as our resident DJs create the ideal environment from early
                evening till late.</p>
            <p>@Dj Groovemaster 7.00P.M - 9.00P.M
                Genre: Funk, Soul, R&B.
            </p>
            <p>@Dj ElectroBeats, Time: 9.00P.M - 12.00A.M
                Genre: EDM, House, Dance
            </p>
            <h3>Transaction options</h3>
            <p>For enhanced and improved convenience for our guests, we gladly welcome both cash and card payments.</p>
            <h3>Halal</h3>
            <p>The question we frequently get asked the most is if our menu is 'Halal.' We are, in fact, glad to announce
                that our outstanding and delectable array of food is indeed 'Halal,' and it is served from 6pm. Wednesdays
                till Sundays</p>
